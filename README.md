# Consul beginner guide

The idea behind this tutorial here is give you an overview how to use the key/value's Consul service for your projects where you don't need to store your configuration values in .config *likes* files anymore.

Consul can update service configurations across thousands of services in a globally distributed fleet in real-time. Configuration is stored in a hierarchical key/value store, and efficient edge triggers push changes out to applications quickly.

## What's Consul?

Consul is a distributed service mesh to connect, secure, and configure services across any runtime platform and public or private cloud.
